<p>I have made a bass viol, after a 1624 original by Henry Jaye.</p>
<p>It is made from spruce and maple, with a 7-piece bent-stave soundboard. The pegs and nut are stained boxwood, and the hook bar is service wood. I chose to experiment with the decoration, including an alternative take on a pierced scroll, and my own design of purfling.
