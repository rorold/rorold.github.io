<p>I'm currently studying musical instrument making at West Dean College and have completed the first year of a two-year FdA course.</p>
<p>I'm based in Oxford and have a particular interest in fretted folk instruments (Cittern, Bouzouki, Octave Mandolin and similar) and in the Viola da Gamba and other early bowed strings.</p>
