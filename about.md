<p>I originally studied physics at university, graduating in 2010, and then worked as a software engineer for 14 years.
<p>I have been playing octave mandolin in folk sessions around Oxford for over 10 years, and various other stringed instruments for years before that. Being something of a nerd and a tinkerer, I've been messing with the setups, tunings and string gauges of my own instruments for about as long as I've been playing them.<p>
<p>I'm now studying musical instrument making at West Dean College and have completed the first year of a two-year FdA course.</p>
<p>I'm based in Oxford and have a particular interest in fretted folk instruments (Cittern, Bouzouki, Octave Mandolin and similar) and in the Viola da Gamba and other early bowed strings.</p>
