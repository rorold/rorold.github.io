<p>I am currently working on a guitar-bodied archtop octave mandolin. It features a soundboard made with bent staves following the same method as historical viols, and a jointed back made from cherry and sycamore.</p>
<p>The outline is taken from an Epiphone Spartan archtop guitar, scaled down to fit a scale length of just over 23".</p>
